## Motor Analysis in Jupyter Notebook

This folder currently containts all the code I've used throughout this project. I'm in the process of commenting it, so please excuse the mess in the meantime. 

In this directory, I added my custom built library from EAGLE. There are several iterations of my PCB here, the version I'm currently using on the robot is v4, but this version does not have common ground. In the future, v6 should be used.
