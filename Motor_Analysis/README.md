## Motor Analysis in Jupyter Notebook

This folder currently containts all the code I've used throughout this project. I'm in the process of commenting it, so please excuse the mess in the meantime. 

Whats important to note here are the Motor_Simulations_and_Torque-Speed_Graphs and Small_motor_analysis. These files are preactically idenitcal, the main difference being the first analysized several Maxon brand DC motors while the second analyzed small coreless pager motors.
