# Robot-Chaser Robot
Kailey Smith

Final Project for MSR program at Northwestern.

Premise: A Micromouse-like robot must chase mice in a convoluted environment with obstacles and walls. The robot must fit between a 6.3mm space due to constraints in the habitat. In order to effectively chase mice, the robot muse move faster than the mice, which peak around 2m/s. Robot will execute high speed manuvers, including 60 to 120 degree turns in order to chase mice. 

MPLAB: Contains all C code, including programs used during breadboard testing and PCB testing

Motor_Analysis: Contains a jupyter notebook in which I analyized different motors to use for the robot. 

PCB_design: Contains all Eagle files, including libraries used and schematics/board desings

habitat_code: Written for the lab I'm working with
