## C and MPLAB

This folder currently containts all the code I've used throughout this project. I'm in the process of commenting it, so please excuse the mess in the meantime. 

Whats important to note here are the 130_PCB_TEST and 170_PCB_TEST projects made in MPLAB. For this project I had to use two different PICs due to confilcts in my original design and chip availibilty during COVID (PIC32MX**130**F256B and PIC32MX**170**F256B). The functionality of both code is the same, I just had to program the same code twice for the different PICs.
